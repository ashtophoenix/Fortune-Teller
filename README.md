# Fortune Teller

I initialized fortune1, fortune2, fortune3, fortune4, and fortune5 with a string value. I used the Math.random() method to generate a random number. I generated a random number between 1 and 5 inclusive and assigned it to the variable randomNumber. I created a selectedFortune variable that is assigned a value based on the value of the randomNumber. the randomNumber corresponds to its fortune. For example, if randomNumber is 1 then the corresponsing fortune is fortune1. I outputted the selected fortune to the console.
